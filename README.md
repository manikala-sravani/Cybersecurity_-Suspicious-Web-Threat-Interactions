Cybersecurity: Suspicious Web Threat Interactions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing network traffic data and identifying suspicious web threat interactions. The project uses Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NetworkX to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), anomaly detection, and visualization.

📌 Features

Data Preprocessing

Cleans and prepares raw traffic logs

Handles timestamps, bytes in/out, IP details

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of inbound/outbound traffic (Bytes In vs Bytes Out)

Protocol usage statistics

Country-wise traffic interactions

Network Visualization

Graph of Source IP ↔ Destination IP connections

Highlighting anomalies and suspicious nodes

Traffic Analysis

Web traffic over time (Bytes In/Out)

Anomaly detection using thresholds/labels

Scatter plots highlighting suspicious interactions

Dark Themed Visualizations

All charts styled in dark background with green/red highlights for cybersecurity insights

📊 Visualizations

📈 Traffic Over Time: Bytes in/out trends
